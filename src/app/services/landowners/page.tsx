                answer: "Working with a developer that doesn't have a portfolio of projects in your service area in a can pose as a major red flag to project success, and working with an experienced developer and operator who's successfully zoned, permitted, constructed, interconnected and operated community solar projects in your service area is a major key to having project success on your land. Ask your developer if they can offer a site tour or a reference to another landowner or a solar farm in your service area!"

                answer: "Exact size requirements vary by interconnection capacity, but we generally require 6+ acres of land or 150,000 of buildable square footage of roof or parking lot area. When you work with Clean Earth, we ensure that every acre or square foot is used effectively. Our local team of community solar experts will give you peace of mind throughout the process."

                question: "If I host a community solar farm, can the solar panels power my farm, home or business operations?",
                answer: "Absolutely! However, since your project can take up to 18 months, if you prefer to start saving immediately on your electricity costs, you can also subscribe to one of our existing community solar projects rather than waiting for your solar farm to become operational. Visit our community solar page to learn how to subscribe to an active solar farm in your service area."
